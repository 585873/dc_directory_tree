# The DeeCee Directoree Tree

Oh noes! The NSA has gone too far in trying to reduce the whole nation to a bunch of data points. Now the entire DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia) area is a directory tree!

You need to figure out how to navigate this place. Write out the absolute and (if applicable) relative paths you would use to go...

1. to Lincoln
2. from Lincoln to Chad
3. from Chad to Arielle
4. from Arielle to Nadia
5. from Nadia to Rachel

The data has been visualized in the attached `index.html` file. A matching directory tree is contained in the `dmv.zip` file. Open it and use your console to test your answers!
